Question 1:
-----------
f6 would equal 8

Question 2:
-----------
The tree would start at the top being 6 and split into 5 and 4
then the 5 would split into 4 and 3
and the 4 would split into 3 and 2
now the tree is bigger with those 4 numbers splitting in 2

                6
               / \
               5  4
              /\  /\
             4  3 3  2
            / \ /\ /\ /\
           3 2 2 1 2 1 1 1

Keeps going until 0 and 1 at bottom of tree
