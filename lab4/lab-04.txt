Question 1:
------------
To get the program to print 10 using i is to first make it so i <= 10 in the loop so it stops on 10 and not stop before 10
As well as take a new variable that holds i so when program ends it prints 10

#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int num;
        for (int i = 0 ; i <= 10 ; ++i) {
        num = i;
    }
     std::cout << num << std::endl;

    return 0;
}



Question 2:
------------
What you can do for it to be infinite for loop is to keep making i = 0 at the end of the loop thus making it never end

Question 3:
------------
The loop would be infinite since i subtracts by one then incriments by one making it stay the same value 1 - 1 = 0 ! to fix this error get rid of the --i; incriment.

Question 4:
------------
Change the continue to a break and it will leave the loop and return a 10 instead of what it was doing before and infinitly loping

Question 5:
------------
There needs to be curly brackets after the for loop and then put the if statement into the loop body

Question 6:
------------
You have to change the while loop conditional to i != 0 instead of !i which doesnt work for this and the loop never gets entered

Question 7:
------------
sum would equal 140
