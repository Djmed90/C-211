Question 1:
-----------
My value for x was 32600 this is because the breakpint stopped right before we gave x a value so it was a random number

Question 2:
-----------
We trace the program similar to the debugger execpt for variables getting random numbers before they are assigned a value.

Question 3:
-----------
First block is main and its result = 0
second block gets added on and its plus_one with param of 0 that returns 1 then get put off stack
we go back to main and add two more blocks the first being plus_two the second on top of plus two being plus_one
once plus one is finished its knocked off then plus_two is knocked off finishing with main

Question 5:
-----------
The return type of main is int

Question 6:
-----------
There are no parameters

Question 7:
-----------
The function does not return a value

Question 8:

You can use a return statement in a void function but it wont return value

Question 9:

The functions are called after the main so when it compiles from top to bottom it sees the function run and has not seen it been declared

Question 10:
